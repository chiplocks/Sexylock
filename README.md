# Sexylock 
November 2023 - 
trying to add a SoftAP to manage User and Uids for an Nfc access control system built around a stepper motor.
currently we have a 2 working codes, that just have to be combined around an if else statment based on the value of A0 on startup.
NFC access controll code will need to be adjusted to read uid list in json.
